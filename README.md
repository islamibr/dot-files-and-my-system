# Dot Files and My System

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository housing my dot files and the intricate architecture of my dual-boot system, featuring Windows 11 and Arch Linux. In this README, I'll provide you with an in-depth look at the choices, philosophies, and tools that power my productivity.

## Dual Boot Setup

My system is strategically set up on two hard disks: one for the operating systems (a snappy 250G SSD) and another for data storage (a capacious 1T HDD). The reasons behind this setup are multi-fold:

1. **Learn Unix/Linux as a Key Skill:**
   - A crucial skill, especially for professional hardware, which predominantly utilizes RedHat.

2. **Build Automation for Streamlined Processes:**
   - Automation reduces time wastage, enhancing overall efficiency.

3. **Customization for a Tailored Experience:**
   - Crafting my system according to my unique needs and preferences.

## Operating Systems of Choice

After experimenting with various distributions (including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Kali), I settled on:

- **Windows 11:**
  - Secondary system for tasks requiring software not supported on Linux (e.g., Office, Altium, MATLAB).

- **Arch Linux:**
  - Main system for coding and daily activities.

## Cloud Sync for Seamless Integration

To minimize the hassle of switching systems, I employ cloud sync apps e.g., search, lectures, quick notes.

## Architectural Philosophy
